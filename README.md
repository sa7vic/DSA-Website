## Overview

DSA Visualizer is an interactive educational platform designed to help students and developers understand data structures and algorithms through visual learning. Each visualizer provides step-by-step animations synchronized with actual code execution, making complex concepts easy to grasp. It is brought to you by Openverse, the open source club of IIIT Kottayam, if you wish to contribute, check out contributing.md 
We use C for code since, the visualizer is specifically tailored for the Datastructure 121 Course at IIIT Kottayam

Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 18+ 
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Website.git
cd DSA-Website

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open the application

You can also build a docker image and run the build isolately, without any setup overhead.
```bash
# After cloning and changing directory
docker build -t algorithima:latest .

# To run the image
docker run -d --name dsa_website \
           -p 1234:80 \
           algorithima:latest
# Build will be running on port localhost:1234, if the port is busy, put another port in docker run command.
```

## 🎨 Design System

Our consistent **dark theme** provides an optimal learning environment:

### 🎨 Color Palette
```css
/* Primary Colors */
--primary: #58a6ff;      /* Blue - actions, highlights */
--secondary: #238636;    /* Green - success states */
--danger: #f85149;       /* Red - errors, warnings */
--warning: #d29922;      /* Yellow - cautions */

/* Interface Colors */
--background: #0d1117;   /* Main dark background */
--surface: #161b22;      /* Panels, cards */
--border: #30363d;       /* Borders, dividers */
--text-primary: #c9d1d9; /* Main text */
--text-secondary: #8b949e; /* Secondary text */

/* Node Visualization */
--node-active: #5bc9b1;  /* Active/highlighted nodes */
--node-inactive: #30363d; /* Default/inactive nodes */
--node-visiting: #f39c12; /* Nodes being processed */
```

### 📱 Responsive Breakpoints
